some elementary crypto tools

### RC-4
 - a simple implementation of RC4
 - a simple program for frequency analysis of first few bytes of the RC4
 key-stream for different random keys

### Vigenere
 - a complete Vigenere cryptanalysis tool. Input the Vigenere cipher, through
 standard input, and the program will try to guess the key, using statistical
 tests like, Kasiski's test (to estimate the key length) and Index of
 coincidence test (to guess the key). Note that the cipher should be atleast
 ~500 characters long for the statistical tests to work.
